# Edge Matcher

This repository represents the final step of a multi-source data processing pipeline to create global edge-matched administrative boundary layers. Datasets are updated when new layers are published by each source, typically done on a weekly basis. Data can be accessed through the following table, as well as this URL which provides additional metadata such as date last updated: [data.fieldmaps.io/edge-matched.json](https://data.fieldmaps.io/edge-matched.json)

| Layer Type (ADM 0-4) | COD + geoBoundaries                                                                                  | geoBoundaries                                                                        |

## Sources

Individual administrative layers are sourced from groups who provide their own curated services.

- [Common Operational Datasets (COD)](https://cod.unocha.org/): by United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA). Boundary data organized by Field Information Services (FIS), with vetting performed by [Information Technology Outreach Services (ITOS)](https://cviog.uga.edu/international-center/).
- [geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/): by the University of William & Mary geoLab in Williamsburg, Virginia.

These groups of sources are combined together into the following thematic outputs:

- Humanitarian (aka operational): Utilizes COD layers when available, falling back on geoBoundaries to fill in gaps. Commonly licensed under Creative Commons Attribution for Intergovernmental Organizations, although some layers may be more restrictive.
- Open (aka academic): Uses geoBoundaries exclusively as a source group. Commonly licensed under Open Data Commons Open Database License, as many sources are derived from OpenStreetMap, but a variety of other permissive licenses are included as well.

In the future, [Second Administrative Level Boundaries (SALB)](https://www.unsalb.org) will be added as a third source for the Authoritative (aka member state provided) thematic output.

## Caveats & Limitations

The outputs generated by this pipeline contain a number of compromises which should be understood before using. There are multitudes of coordinate reference systems used in GIS, as a single one cannot perfectly preserve all aspects of shape, area, distance and direction. Similarly, a single global administrative boundary layer cannot perfectly capture all aspects of its underlying sources, and the right format should be taken for appropriate use.

- These datasets are only intended for use at the global or regional level. For representing an individual administrative layer, a source should be taken prior to edge modifications being applied, as this is more faithful to the original.
- The ADM0 layer used for clipping is not authoritative, and is do not imply official endorsement or acceptance by the United Nations, OpenStreetMap or this author.
- Individual administrative layers have disputed areas removed prior to processing, as these areas are specially represented through attributes in the ADM0 line layer. Care should be given in representing these areas properly for cartographic outputs.

## Methodology

Being the last stage of a multi-step pipeline, other related repositories are involved in the production of this dataset, each with a discrete and self-contained purpose. Overall, data goes through the following 6 steps from originals to edge-matched:

1. Originals: Represents data as collected from the source. For some layers these are downloaded manually from web portals. For others, programatic API access is available.
2. Normalized: Within a single source group, there may be small variations in the way layers are formatted. This stage performs operations to ensure file, layer, and attribute names are consistent within the same source group.
3. Standardized: Between multiple source groups, this step conditions attributes in a common format suitable for merging together in a hybrid dataset. Here, versioned IDs are assigned to each admin area.
4. Extended: To resolve gaps between layers, a voronoi-like algorithm is applied along polygon edges to extend them outward. The extent of the resulting polygon is 100% larger in each direction, purposefully over-sized for later clipping.
5. Clipped: To resolve overlaps between layers, extended layers are clipped to a pre-defined ADM0 layer.
6. Edge-Matched: An aggregation of all clipped layers are assembled into the final output.

### Intermediate Data

The outputs of intermediate steps 2-5 can be accessed through the following links. These URLs are used internally to keep track of metadata about layers within source groups.

- COD: [data.fieldmaps.io/cod.json](https://data.fieldmaps.io/cod.json)
- geoBoundaries: [data.fieldmaps.io/geoboundaries.json](https://data.fieldmaps.io/geoboundaries.json)

### Data Adapter (Step 1-3)

The [Data Adapter](https://github.com/fieldmaps/data-adapter) repository is responsible for processing originals into normalized and standardized versions. Since each transformation at this stage involves only re-naming or files / layers / fields, and doesn't require geometry transformation or spatial relations, it is contained within this sub-pipeline.

### Polygon to Voronoi (Step 4)

The [Polygon to Voronoi](https://github.com/fieldmaps/polygon-voronoi) repository is a general purpose tool that has been broken out into its own self-contained unit. It does not modify attributes in any way, and the geometry transformations do not rely on any external data as overlays.

### ADM0 Template (Step 5)

The [ADM0 Template](https://github.com/fieldmaps/adm0-template) repository combines UNmap, used for political boundaries, with OpenStreetMap, used for coastline boundaries. The result is a very high resolution ADM0 boundary layer that is used for the clipping stage. Like the polygon to voronoi tool, this is also separated into its own unit as it can be used apart from this project.

### Edge Matcher (Step 5-6)

The current repository takes extended boundaries from the polygon to voronoi tool, and clips them with the output of the ADM0 Template repo into the datasets linked to at the top of this page.

## Attribute Fields
